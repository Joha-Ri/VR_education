# Virtual Reality on Education 👓

## Project Overview 🗒️
This project investigates the impact of parental involvement on student success, specifically examining how parental support and education influence students' academic performance. The analysis focuses on three main hypotheses regarding the relationships between parental support, education, and student success metrics, including success rates and GPA. 
The project encompasses the full data analysis process, including data gathering, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, KPIs, A/B testing, and visualization.

## Organization and Project Management 👀

## Background 💡
Parental involvement has long been recognized as a crucial factor in student academic success. This project aims to quantify the influence of different levels of parental support and education on student performance, utilizing a dataset that encompasses various student demographics and performance metrics.

## Key Questions Addressed ❔
Demographics and VR Usage:
How does VR usage differ among various demographic groups (age, gender, region)?
Are there specific groups that are underutilizing VR technology?

Impact on Engagement and Learning Outcomes:
What correlations exist between VR usage (measured by hours per week and access to VR) and student engagement levels?
How does VR impact creativity and improvement in learning outcomes?

Resource Allocation and Optimization Strategies:
How does the level of school support and access to VR influence student outcomes?

## Data Pipeline 🔄
The data pipeline involved the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathering a dataset that includes variables such as student demographics, parental support, education levels, and academic performance.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data integrity.
Data Transformation: Creating new variables, such as success rates and failure rates, and categorizing data for analysis.
Data Storage: Organizing the cleaned dataset for easy access during analysis.

## Methodology ▶️
The analysis utilized both descriptive and inferential statistical methods:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting initial analysis to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Defining metrics to evaluate student success related to parental involvement.
A/B Testing: Implementing hypothesis testing to assess the significance of parental support and education on student performance.

## Findings Summary 🔍
Hypothesis 1: There is a significant difference in success rates between students with low and high parental support (p-value = 4.94e-08).
Hypothesis 2: Parental education level impacts failure rates, but the results (p-value = 0.0610) suggest a weaker relationship.
Hypothesis 3: The combination of high parental support and education significantly influences GPA (p-value = 0.0011).

## Recommendations 📝
Based on the findings, it is recommended that schools and educators foster greater parental involvement through workshops and resources that educate parents on how to support their children's academic journey. Schools should also consider policies that promote engagement between parents and the education system.

## Conclusion ✔️
The project highlights the critical role of parental involvement in enhancing student success. While higher parental support correlates with better academic outcomes, the impact of parental education on failure rates indicates the need for additional support systems to aid students facing challenges regardless of their parents' educational background.
